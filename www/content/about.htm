<p><strong>pomp</strong> provides a very general realization of nonlinear partially-observed Markov processes (AKA state-space models, nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems). One specifies a model's process and measurement components; the package uses these functions in algorithms to simulate, analyze, and fit the model to data.</p>

<p>At the moment, algorithms are provided for basic <strong>particle filtering</strong> (AKA sequential importance sampling or sequential Monte Carlo), <strong>trajectory matching</strong>, the <strong>approximate Bayesian sequential Monte Carlo algorithm of Liu &amp; West (2001)</strong>, the <strong>likelihood maximization by iterated filtering (MIF)</strong> method of Ionides, Breto, and King (PNAS, 103:18438-18443, 2006), and the <strong>nonlinear forecasting</strong> method of Ellner and Kendall. Future support for a variety of other algorithms is envisioned. A working group of the <a href="http://nceas.ucsb.edu">National&nbsp;Center&nbsp;for&nbsp;Ecological&nbsp;Analysis&nbsp;and&nbsp;Synthesis&nbsp;(NCEAS)</a>, "Inference for Mechanistic Models", is currently implementing additional methods for this package.</p>

<p>Simple worked examples are provided in <a href="http://cran.at.r-project.org/web/packages/pomp/vignettes/">vignettes</a> and in the <tt>examples</tt> directory of the installed package.</p>

<p>The package is provided under the GPL. Contributions are welcome, as are comments, suggestions, examples, and bug reports. Please send these to <tt>kingaa at umich dot edu</tt>.</p>
