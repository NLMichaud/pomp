<p><strong>pomp</strong> is built around a very general realization
of nonlinear partially-observed Markov processes (AKA state-space
models, nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems). One specifies a
model's process and measurement components; the package uses these
functions in algorithms to simulate, analyze, and fit the model to
data.</p>
<p>At the moment, algorithms are provided for <strong>particle
filtering</strong> (AKA sequential importance sampling or
sequential Monte Carlo), the <strong>likelihood maximization by
iterated filtering (MIF)</strong> method of Ionides, Breto, and
King (PNAS, 103:18438-18443, 2006), and the <strong>nonlinear
forecasting</strong> method of Ellner and Kendall. Future support
for a variety of other algorithms is envisioned. A working group of
the <a href=
"http://nceas.ucsb.edu">National&nbsp;Center&nbsp;for&nbsp;Ecological&nbsp;Analysis&nbsp;and&nbsp;Synthesis&nbsp;(NCEAS)</a>,
"Inference for Mechanistic Models", is currently implementing
additional methods for this package.</p>
<p>Simple worked examples are provided in <a href=
"http://cran.at.r-project.org/web/packages/pomp/vignettes/">vignettes</a>
and in the "examples" directory of the installed package.</p>
<p>The package is provided under the GPL. Contributions are
welcome, as are comments, suggestions, examples, and bug
reports.</p>
<p>The development of this package has been aided by support from
the U.S. N.S.F (Grants #EF-0545276, #EF-0430120) and by the
"Inference for Mechanistic Models" Working Group supported by the
National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, a Center
funded by NSF (Grant #DEB-0553768), the University of California,
Santa Barbara, and the State of California.</p>
