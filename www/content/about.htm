<p><strong>pomp</strong> provides a very general realization of nonlinear partially-observed Markov processes (AKA nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems). These are a generalization of the familiar state-space and hidden Markov models to nonlinear, non-Gaussian processes in either discrete or continuous time. In <strong>pomp</strong>, one can implement a model by specifying its unobserved process and measurement components; the package uses these functions in algorithms to simulate, analyze, and fit the model to data.</p>

<p>At the moment, support is provided for</p>

<ul>
  <li>basic particle filtering (AKA sequential importance sampling or sequential Monte Carlo),</li>

  <li>trajectory matching,</li>

  <li>the approximate Bayesian sequential Monte Carlo algorithm of Liu&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;West&nbsp;(2001),</li>

  <li>the particle Markov chain Monte Carlo method of Andrieu et al.&nbsp;(2010),</li>

  <li>the iterated filtering method of Ionides,&nbsp;Breto,&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;King&nbsp;(2006),</li>

  <li>the nonlinear forecasting method of Ellner&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Kendall,</li>

  <li>probe-matching methods (e.g., Kendall et al. 1999), and</li>

  <li>power-spectrum-matching methods of Reuman et al. (2006).</li>
</ul>Future support for a variety of other algorithms is envisioned. A working group of the <a href="http://nceas.ucsb.edu">National&nbsp;Center&nbsp;for&nbsp;Ecological&nbsp;Analysis&nbsp;and&nbsp;Synthesis&nbsp;(NCEAS)</a>, "Inference for Mechanistic Models", is currently implementing additional methods for this package.

<p>Simple worked examples are provided in <a href="http://cran.at.r-project.org/web/packages/pomp/vignettes/">vignettes</a> and in the <tt>examples</tt> directory of the installed package.</p>

<p>The package is provided under the GPL. Contributions are welcome, as are comments, suggestions, examples, and bug reports. Please send these to <tt>kingaa at umich dot edu</tt>.</p>

<p><strong>pomp</strong> is in the beta phase of development: features are actively being added and backward compatibility of changes is not guaranteed.</p>
