  abstract = {The purpose of time series analysis via mechanistic models is to reconcile
	the known or hypothesized structure of a dynamical system with observations
	collected over time. We develop a framework for constructing nonlinear
	mechanistic models and carrying out inference. Our framework permits
	the consideration of implicit dynamic models, meaning statistical
	models for stochastic dynamical systems which are specified by a
	simulation algorithm to generate sample paths. Inference procedures
	that operate on implicit models are said to have the plug-and-play
	property. Our work builds on recently developed plug-and-play inference
	methodology for partially observed Markov models. We introduce a
	class of implicitly specified Markov chains with stochastic transition
	rates, and we demonstrate its applicability to open problems in statistical
	inference for biological systems. As one example, these models are
	shown to give a fresh perspective on measles transmission dynamics.
	As a second example, we present a mechanistic analysis of cholera
	incidence data, involving interaction between two competing strains
	of the pathogen Vibrio cholerae.},

  abstract = {Statistical inference for mechanistic models of partially observed
	dynamic systems is an active area of research. Most existing inference
	methods place substantial restrictions upon the form of models that
	can be fitted and hence upon the nature of the scientific hypotheses
	that can be entertained and the data that can be used to evaluate
	them. In contrast, the so-called methods require only simulations
	from a model and are thus free of such restrictions. We show the
	utility of the plug-and-play approach in the context of an investigation
	of measles transmission dynamics. Our novel methodology enables us
	to ask and answer questions that previous analyses have been unable
	to address. Specifically, we demonstrate that plug-and-play methods
	permit the development of a modelling and inference framework applicable
	to data from both large and small populations. We thereby obtain
	novel insights into the nature of heterogeneity in mixing and comment
	on the importance of including extra-demographic stochasticity as
	a means of dealing with environmental stochasticity and model misspecification.
	Our approach is readily applicable to many other epidemiological
	and ecological systems.},

  number = {10},
  month = {Oct},
  abstract = {Case notifications of pertussis have shown an increase in a number
	of countries with high rates of routine pediatric immunization. This
	has led to significant public health concerns over a possible pertussis
	re-emergence. A leading proposed explanation for the observed increase
	in incidence is the loss of immunity to pertussis, which is known
	to occur after both natural infection and vaccination. Little is
	known, however, about the typical duration of immunity and its epidemiological
	implications. Here, we analyze a simple mathematical model, exploring
	specifically the inter-epidemic period and fade-out frequency. These
	predictions are then contrasted with detailed incidence data for
	England and Wales. We find model output to be most sensitive to assumptions
	concerning naturally acquired immunity, which allows us to estimate
	the average duration of immunity. Our results support a period of
	natural immunity that is, on average, long-lasting (at least 30 years)
	but inherently variable.},
